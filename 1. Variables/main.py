#This is how we make new variable. Lets call it 'x'.

x = 5
#or
x=5
#This two variables are exactly same. so it means spacebar dont change anything.
#This variable type is integer.

word = "Hello World."
#or
word='Hello World.'
#This variable type is string.

float_num = 5.5
#This variable type is float.

bool1 = True
bool2 = False
#This variables type are boolean.
#boolean only can be True or False.


#Lets try print them individually.
#To print something we need to use print() function.

print(x)

print(word)

print(num)

print(bool1)
print(bool2)

#Try running this code to see what is does.
