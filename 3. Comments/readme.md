        Comments

------------------------------------

Comments in programming are lines of text that are added to the code to
provide an explanation or clarification of what the code does. Comments
are not executed by the computer and are ignored by the compiler or 
interpreter.

    Compiler - is a software program that takes the entire code and 
              converts it into an executable file that can be run on a
              computer.

    Interpreter - is a software program that reads the code line by line
              and immediately executes each line, without creating an 
              executable file.

    Both are software programs that help a computer understand and execute
    code written by a programmer.

Comments are meant to be read by other programmers, including yourself, to
understand the purpose and functionality of the code.

In Python, there are two types of comments.single-line commments and 
multi-line comments.Here are some examples of both types of commenting 
methods in Python:

------------------------------------

Single-line comment:

    #This is a single-line comment in Python
    print("Hello, World!") # This line prints a message to console
    
    x = 10 # This line assigns the value 10 to the variable x

------------------------------------

Multi-line comment:
    
    """
    This is a multi-line comment in Python
    This is used to provide a detailed explanation of a section of code
    In this example, we are defining a function that adds two numbers
    """
    def add_numbers(x, y):
        # This line adds two numbers and returns the result
        return x + y

------------------------------------

It is important to add comments in your code to improve its readability and
maintainability. Code without comments can be difficult to understand, especially
for other programmers who are not familiar with the code. Comments can provide
context and explain the purpose of the code, making it easier for other
programmers to understand and modify the code in the future.


Here are some Guidelines for writing comments in Python:

    1. Keep comments short and to the point. Comments should explain the cod in
      a concise and clear manner.
    2. Use comments to explain why the code is doing something, not what the code is
      doing. The code should be self-explanatory, and the comments should provide
      context and explain the purpose of the code.
    3. Update comments whenever you modify the code. Comments that are out-of-date
      can be worse than no comments at all.
